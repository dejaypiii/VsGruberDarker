# VsGruberDarker

A Visual Studio version of the Gruber Darker color scheme based on the color themes for Emacs by Jason Blevins, for BBEdit by John Gruber and for deftheme by Alexey Kutepov a.k.a. rexim.
VsGruberDarker is based on a conversion of my adapted fork of the VS Code Gruber Darker by Francisco Silvaon.

The VS Code theme got converted with [theme-converter-for-vs](https://github.com/microsoft/theme-converter-for-vs).
